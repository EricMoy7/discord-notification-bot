This project will support multiple Discord notifications. The primary focus right now is crypto
notifications either directly from APIs, webpages, or a specific chain.

The discord bot is still in development. You can host your own varient by creating a new bot
from the discord development website. After the bot is setup all that is required is a .env file
setup the same directory.

.env should contain
DISCORD_TOKEN=
ONE_ADDRESS=

Currently developing notifications for:
DeFi kingdoms (Directly from https://kingdom.watch/) - Tracking Garden value - Overall wallet value - Everything else from that webpage
